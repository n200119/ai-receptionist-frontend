 Amego, is an AI-driven task management system with automated call and SMS reminders. Users can create tasks with a title, description, mobile number, and due date via a React.js frontend and a Node.js/Express backend using MongoDB. The system continuously monitors due dates and sends an SMS reminder one hour before the deadline and makes an automated call 30 minutes before the due time using Twilio API. Authentication is handled through JWT tokens, ensuring secure access. Users can update reminders, mark tasks as complete, and view task history. The time is stored and processed in IST format for consistency. The project is deployed on Render, with Git used for version control. Tasks marked as complete update with the current timestamp. This system ensures efficient task tracking and timely reminders for users.
